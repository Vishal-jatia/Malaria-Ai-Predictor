Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease, claiming over 400,000 lives each year, mainly children under 5. By targeting the water bodies where mosquitoes lay eggs, the disease can be controlled or even eliminated completely. Explore more datasets to understand the problem well and come up with a solution to curb this in a sustainable manner.

**Key Features of our Solution:**
 Our AI model can predict outbreaks of malaria of mainly two cotegories namely P.falciparum(one of the most harmful types) and P.vivax in different regions of the Earth based on the past years data that it has been trained with. The predicted values depend on various factors that the user must provide.
